# Smash Norway's website

This is an open sourced project to create a new website for Smash Norway - an organization that's all about playing
Super Smash Bros Melee.

The website is not yet online, but will be found on [smashnorge.no](http://www.smashnorge.no).

## Planned features

If you're curious about the process, we've created a [trello-board](https://trello.com/b/dZ7MlJDa/smash-norge) for you to check out. You'll find all major upcoming
features there.

## We'd love your help!

We're currently doing a lot of setup stuff, but we'll soon be ready to accept pull requests on changes and improvements.
This is a totally voluntary project, so any help is greatly appreciated.

## Initial setup

Clone the repository, and make sure you've installed [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [bower](http://bower.io/).

Go into the folder `/static-web` and install Bower's dependencies:

    bower install

Start a local web server with the root in `/static-web`, and you're ready to go.

Not a lot to see yet - of course. We're hoping to get a basic version up and running in a few weeks.
